# Bellybutton

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to get more familiar with using Javascript and HTML. This was done by creating a [webpage](https://github.com/stwpf01/Bellybutton/blob/main/index.html) using information provided for in the [samples.json](https://github.com/stwpf01/Bellybutton/blob/main/samples.json) file and importing it into the webpage by creating code in the [charts.js](https://github.com/stwpf01/Bellybutton/blob/main/charts.js) file. In the charts file three different kinds of graphs were made and populated with the information from the previously mentioned samples.json file. Further tweaks and adjustments to the webpage were made by creating the [style.css](https://github.com/stwpf01/Bellybutton/blob/main/css/style.css) file.

## Results

![webpage](https://github.com/stwpf01/Bellybutton/blob/main/images/webpage.png)

While not the most elegant webpage, it works in a few ways; Firstly, one can select from the drop-down menu on the left to select an ID number belonging to an individual. Secondly, after selecting an ID number, the three charts (a bar, gauge, and bubble) update to show the sample of bacterias collected from the individuals bellybutton. When hovering over a bar or a bubble in their respective charts, further details are given and specify which bacteria is the most commonly found. The gauge chart is there to provide how often the individual washes in the chance there is a correlation between washing frequency and types of bacteria found. 

## Summary

As stated before, the appearance of the webpage is rudimentary compared to what is possible/common. But having a webpage being correctly populated with information is something necessary to learn and know now rather than later.
